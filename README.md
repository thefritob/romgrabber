# romgrabber
A simple script to download files from a web directory that matches certain criteria with exclusion words and filenames to ignore.  

Grouping right now is done by PS and not reliable for anything that requires more than one file (i.e. CD images like Disc 2)  Works well for cartridge based roms

Grouping will eventually be coded rather than just the highest value in the group.
